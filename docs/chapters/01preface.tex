Welcome to the documentation for our open-source desktop GUI tool, \textbf{Ostival}, a comprehensive design environment built with Qt 6, inspired by the capabilities of industry-leading platforms.

As electronic design automation (EDA) is rapidly growing. Complex hardware system development is becoming increasingly challenging, and access to powerful, flexible, and accessible tools is paramount. This project was born from the vision of providing an open-source alternative that empowers students, researchers, and hobbyists to design, simulate, and analyze hardware implementation without the barriers of constantly proprietary software licenses.

This manual serves as your essential guide to navigating and harnessing the full potential of this GUI tool. Whether you are a seasoned professional transitioning from commercial EDA tools, a student learning the ropes of system design, or an enthusiast exploring new possibilities, this documentation will walk you through installation, core functionalities, advanced features, and customization options.

We believe that open-source software has the power to democratize technology and accelerate innovation. We encourage you to explore, experiment, and contribute to making this tool an indispensable asset for the global design community. Your participation is vital to its continued growth and success.
