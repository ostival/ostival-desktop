## Description
Our motivation to start this project is:

1. **Democratizing Hardware:** We believe chip design should be accessible to everyone. This project aims to break down the barriers of expensive, proprietary EDA tools by providing a free, open-source flow from Verilog to GDS.
2. **Modernizing EDA:** We're bringing a modern touch to EDA with a tool that is not only powerful and efficient but also intuitive to use, moving past outdated design philosophies.
3. **The Future is Open:** The future of hardware development is open. This project fosters a collaborative ecosystem where innovation flourishes through transparency and community-driven development, rather than through closed-source solutions.

## Features
- High-performance C++ core optimized for speed and scalability
- Security and privacy-preserving design
- Integrates with leading open-source synthesis tools (e.g., Icarus Verilog, Yosys, ABC)
- Scalable and modular design for handling large VLSI design flows
